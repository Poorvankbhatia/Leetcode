/*
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.



Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.


Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

for example:
100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111. So we only need get the min number large or equal to num, then do substraction
