/*

Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1],
we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.
After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
Note:

arr will have length in range [1, 10].
arr[i] will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1].

Algorithm: Iterate through the array, each time all elements to the left are smaller (or equal) to all elements to the right, there is a new chunck.
Use two arrays to store the left max and right min to achieve O(n) time complexity. Space complexity is O(n) too.
This algorithm can be used to solve ver2 too.

For a increasing straight line , (Max at i) < (Min of I + 1)...
i.e [1..4] max =4 , [5..7] min in 5 ,
So , If Max < Min , then there is no element on the right side , who belongs on the left side as per above observation.
if Max > Min, it means , there is some element on the right side, who belongs on the left, so we CANNOT create a chunk.
