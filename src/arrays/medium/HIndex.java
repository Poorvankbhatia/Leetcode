/*

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers
have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

1) The easier solution which given by the wiki page:

First we order the values of f from the largest to the lowest value.
Then, we try to find the last number >= its index, its index is the H-index.

For example, if we have a researcher with 5 publications:
25, 8, 5, 3, 3 citations respectively,
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 as index.

The number is 5, H-index is 3.


2) The O(n) solution:
A researcher have 5 publications:
A, B, C, D, E with
5, 8,10, 4, 3 citation respectively.

After first loop:

  for (int c: citations)
        if (c > len)
            count[len]++;
        else
            count[c]++;
we have the count array:

value: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3
index: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
In second loop:

  for (int i = len; i >= 0; i--) {
        total += count[i];
        if (total >= i)
            return i;
    }
Step 1: index is 5, total = 3.
Step 2: index is 4, total = 4, return 4.
