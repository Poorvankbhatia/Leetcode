/*

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
Output: True
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
Note:

1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
0 < nums[i] < 10000.

    We can solve this problem recursively, we keep an array for sum of each partition and a boolean array to check whether an element is
     already taken into some partition or not.
First we need to check some base cases,
If K is 1, then we already have our answer, complete array is only subset with same sum.
If N < K, then it is not possible to divide array into subsets with equal sum, because we canâ€™t divide the array into more than N parts.
If sum of array is not divisible by K, then it is not possible to divide the array. We will proceed only if k divides sum. Our goal reduces
 to divide array into K parts where sum of each part should be array_sum/K
In below code a recursive method is written which tries to add array element into some subset. If sum of this subset reaches required sum,
 we iterate for next part recursively, otherwise we backtrack for different set of elements. If number of subsets whose sum reaches the
  required sum is (K-1), we flag that it is possible to partition array into K parts with equal sum, because remaining elements already
   have a sum equal to required sum.
