/*

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output:
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.


Notes:

1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
1 <= ages[i] <= 120.

Intuition

Instead of processing all 20000 people, we can process pairs of (age, count) representing how many people are that age.
Since there are only 120 possible ages, this is a much faster loop.

Algorithm

For each pair (ageA, countA), (ageB, countB), if the conditions are satisfied with respect to age, then countA * countB pairs of
people made friend requests.

If ageA == ageB, then we overcounted: we should have countA * (countA - 1) pairs of people making friend requests instead, as you
cannot friend request yourself.

Time Complexity: O(Aâ€‹2+N), where NN is the number of people, and A is the number of ages.

Space Complexity: O(A), the space used to store count.
