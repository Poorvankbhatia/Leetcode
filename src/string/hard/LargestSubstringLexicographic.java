/*

Given a string s, return the last substring of s in lexicographical order.



Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: The substrings are ["a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The lexicographically maximum substring is "bab".
Example 2:

Input: "leetcode"
Output: "tcode"


Note:

1 <= s.length <= 4 * 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.

/*
Edit : why it is O(n) and why we can move for i = i + k + 1

bbbâ€¦bbbbbba for this case, if we just update i to i + 1,time complexity will downgrade to o(n^2).
Let me try to prove why it safely move from i to i + k + 1. For example, for "cabcabx" the matching pattern is 'cab',
at 'x' two candidates are mismatching. since 'x' > 'c', wen need move i, that's true we can just move to i + 1.
However, as long as 'cab' is matching pattern. both 'a' and 'b' have been visited by j. so we can safely move to i + k + 1.
In other words, now j becomes i, i becomes to j. why do you want to go back a visited index? the idea is a little similar with KMP.
