/*
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200.
If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT

    DECLARE M INT;
    SET M=N-1;
    RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET M
    );
  END
-- USING TOP (Not supported in LeetCode)
Select TOP 1 Salary from Employee where Salary in ( SELECT TOP N DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC );
-- ANOTHER METHOD
Select Salary from Employee where Salary in ( SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT N) LIMIT 1;
