/*
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |

SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS 'ConsecutiveNums' FROM Logs l1,Logs l2,Logs l3 WHERE l1.Num=l2.Num AND l2.Num=l3.Num AND l1.id+1=l2.id AND l2.id+1=l3.id;

--  we need to add a keyword DISTINCT because it will display a duplicated number if one number appears more than 3 times consecutively.
