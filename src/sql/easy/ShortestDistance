/*
Table Point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

 */

SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x-p2.x)) as shortest FROM Point p1 JOIN Point p2 ON p1.x!=p2.x

/*
To get the distances of each two points, we need to join this table with itself and use ABS() function since the distance is nonnegative.
Trick here is to add the condition in the join to avoid calculating the distance between a point with itself.
