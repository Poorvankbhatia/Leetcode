/*
Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree DLLNode and p_id is its parent DLLNode's id.

+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Each DLLNode in the tree can be one of three types:
Leaf: if the DLLNode is a leaf DLLNode.
Root: if the DLLNode is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the DLLNode is neither a leaf DLLNode nor a root DLLNode.
Write a query to print the DLLNode id and the type of the DLLNode. Sort your output by the DLLNode id. The result for the above sample is:
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
Explanation

Node '1' is root DLLNode, because its parent DLLNode is NULL and it has child DLLNode '2' and '3'.
Node '2' is inner DLLNode, because it has parent DLLNode '1' and child DLLNode '4' and '5'.
Node '3', '4' and '5' is Leaf DLLNode, because they have parent DLLNode and they don't have child DLLNode.

And here is the image of the sample tree as below:
			                    1
			                  /   \
                      2       3
                    /   \
                  4       5
Note

If there is only one DLLNode on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
