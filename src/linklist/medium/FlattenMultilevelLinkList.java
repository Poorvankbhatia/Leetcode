/*
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer,
which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on,
to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]

How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]


Constraints:

Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5

        // Pointer
        Node p = head;
        while( p!= null) {
            /* CASE 1: if no child, proceed */
            if( p.child == null ) {
                p = p.next;
                continue;
            }
            /* CASE 2: got child, find the tail of the child and link it to p.next */
            Node temp = p.child;
            // Find the tail of the child
            while( temp.next != null )
                temp = temp.next;
            // Connect tail with p.next, if it is not null
            temp.next = p.next;
            if( p.next != null )  p.next.prev = temp;
            // Connect p with p.child, and remove p.child
            p.next = p.child;
            p.child.prev = p;
            p.child = null;
        }
        return head;
    }

}

/*

Basic idea is straight forward:

Start form the head , move one step each time to the next node
When meet with a node with child, say node p, follow
its child chain to the end and connect the tail node with p.next, by doing this we merged the child chain back to the main thread
Return to p and proceed until find next node with child.
Repeat until reach null
